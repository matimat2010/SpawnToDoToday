# Spawn To-Do Today
Checklist which respawn with daily duties every day, and date specific task as well on their dates. 

### Overview
As a user who enjoys a rhythm to their day, I want to be able to have my daily activities re-spawn in an checklist application over night, while being able to add future events which will spawn on the correct days. The goal is to wake up in the morning, open the application, and see what needs to be done for that day. The application will live on the web to be able to be accessed anywhere. Imagine if a person: works out, stretches, reads etc.. every moring; they can open the application, check off their daily rituals as they execute them, and then start checking off the activities unique to the current day, next morning when they wake up, the application has already set their day up for them with their daily rituals and activities for that day.
